# Cryptography Algorithms Implementation in C# (.NET)

Welcome to this repository! ðŸš€ Here, you will find a collection of classic and modern cryptographic algorithms implemented in **C# using .NET**, designed both for educational purposes and practical exploration of encryption techniques.

## Features

This project includes implementations of the following algorithms:

* **Caesar Cipher** â€“ Simple substitution cipher for basic encryption practice.
* **VigenÃ¨re Cipher** â€“ A polyalphabetic cipher demonstrating more advanced encryption.
* **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** â€“ Securely generates shared keys over an insecure channel.
* **Prime Number Factorization** â€“ Demonstrates the mathematical foundations behind modern encryption.
* **RSA Algorithm** â€“ Implements public-key cryptography for secure data transmission.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET 7 (or latest)
* **Development Tools:** Visual Studio / VS Code
* **Testing:** Unit tests included for verifying algorithm correctness
